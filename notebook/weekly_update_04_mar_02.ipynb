This is, using the distribution for the return of instruments, in this case bonds, they compute the expected value and the covariance matrix of fictional zero-coupon bonds (fictional because the maturity remain the same in this instruments, and in real life, instruments mature). And then, they use an objective function for minimize the volatility in the portfolio given an expected desired return for the portfolio and that the sum of positions only account for a given initial wealth.</li>\n",

      "<li>For calculating the Expected value and covariance between fixed-income instruments, they decompose these instruments into a sum of zero-coupon bonds, and then they make a decision for choosing a model for the evolution of interest rates.
