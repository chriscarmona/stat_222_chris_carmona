The reason for this is that my research is widely applicable to the functions carried by the International Reserve Division in the Central Bank of Mexico, my current employer, and they use R as the main software for data analysis.

The discount function estimated with cubic splines will not necessarily match those values so applications of the estimated function will not respect the fundamental no-arbitrage pricing principle.\n",
      "1. For cubic spline, there is no guarantee whatsoever that the discount function estimated using cubic splines has an economically credible form. In particular, the discount function should be positive and decreasing (which will ensure positive forward rates), but there is nothing in the approach ensuring that.\n",
      "1. For cubic and Nelson-Siegel, small variations in the input bond prices may have a substantial effect on the estimated discount function and yield curve. In particular, a change in the input price of a short-maturity bond may even affect the long-maturity end of the estimated curves.\n",
      "1. For Nelson-Siegel, the necessity of incorporate estimation by Generalized Linear Models is way more complicated and computationally expensive.\n",
      "1. For Nelson-Siegel, the slope and the curvature factors decay rapidly to zero as the maturity increases. Hence, it is difficult to fit medium- and long-term yields. An additional curvature term can be added to reduce this problem, but the complexity in the model is increased even more."
